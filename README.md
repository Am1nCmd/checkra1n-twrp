# checkra1n TWRP

> Automate TWRP commands to launch checkra1n on arm64 Android

Copies an OpenRecoveryScript (checkra1n.zip) file to `/data/checkra1n` and a recovery command to `/cache/recovery/command` to execute checkra1n for the next launch of TWRP

tl;dr one tap checkra1n execution for Android.


**Requirements**

- Rooted Android device
- USB-C to USB-A Adapter
- TWRP Custom Recovery
- Supported iOS/tvOS device

## Features

- Boots to TWRP and executes checkra1n with one button
- Provides DFU Instructions in App
- Automaically reboots to Android once it detects checkra1n is complete 

### Instructions

- **Root Required**
	- Open the App
	- Allow root/su permissions
	- Tap the reboot button

## FAQ

- **Why run in recovery?**
    - TWRP provides an environment with fewer services fighting over the USB controller. checkra1n relies on a highly controlled data flow over USB.
- **Will this work with all Android phones?**
	- No. If you could already do this manually in TWRP, yes definitely. My Nexus 5X (2015) and Mi Mix 3 (2018) both work.
